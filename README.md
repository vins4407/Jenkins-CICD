Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Project
This repository contains the source code and configuration files for implementing a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins. The CI/CD pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment processes, providing a streamlined and efficient workflow for software development.

Blog Post
For a detailed guide and explanation of the CI/CD pipeline setup, you can refer to the accompanying blog post: CI/CD with Jenkins.

Project Structure
The project is organized to demonstrate a basic CI/CD workflow. The key components include:

Source Code: The source code for the application is available in the src directory.

Jenkinsfile: The Jenkins pipeline is defined in the Jenkinsfile, specifying the stages and steps for building, testing, and deploying the application.

Dockerfile: If applicable, the Dockerfile in the root directory outlines the containerization of the application.

Configuration Files: Any additional configuration files required for the CI/CD process are located in the config directory.

Getting Started
To set up the CI/CD pipeline locally or integrate it into your own Jenkins instance, follow these steps:

Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/vins4407/Jenkins-CICD.git
Follow the instructions in the blog post CI/CD with Jenkins for a step-by-step guide on configuring and running the pipeline.

Customize the pipeline to suit your specific project requirements by modifying the Jenkinsfile and configuration files.
