# Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Project

This repository contains the source code and configuration files for implementing a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins. The CI/CD pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment processes, providing a streamlined and efficient workflow for software development.

## Blog Post

For a detailed guide and explanation of the CI/CD pipeline setup, you can refer to the accompanying blog post: [CI/CD with Jenkins](https://blog.ivinayak.tech/cicd-with-jenkins).

## Project Structure

The project is organized to demonstrate a basic CI/CD workflow. The key components include:

- **Source Code**: The source code for the application is available in the `src` directory.
  
- **Dockerfile**:  The Dockerfile in the root directory outlines the containerization of the application.

- **Configuration Files**: Any additional configuration files required for the CI/CD process are located in the `root` directory.

## Getting Started

To set up the CI/CD pipeline locally or integrate it into your own Jenkins instance, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vins4407/Jenkins-CICD.git
   ```

2. Follow the instructions in the blog post [CI/CD with Jenkins](https://blog.ivinayak.tech/cicd-with-jenkins) for a step-by-step guide on configuring and running the pipeline.

3. Customize the pipeline to suit your specific project requirements by modifying the Jenkinsfile and configuration files.

## Contributions

Contributions to enhance and improve the CI/CD pipeline are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request.
